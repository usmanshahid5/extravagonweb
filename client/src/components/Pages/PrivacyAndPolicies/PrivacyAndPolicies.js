                  suspended/revoked, license suspension for points, license revoked, resisting arrest, or failing to

            </li>
            <li>You must possess a mobile phone in your own name that we can verify through text message.</li>
            <li>You must be a registered user of ExtraVagant.</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Renter Eligibility Documentation:</strong><br/>
            Acceptance of a renter into the ExtraVagant program shall be in the sole discretion of ExtraVagant. As a
            renter you are required to notify ExtraVagant of any changes to your eligibility, including and not limited
            to the status of a driver&rsquo;s license, or any criminal charges, prior to renting a car using the
            services. Failure to notify and gain proper approvals will result in your account being deactivated. In
            addition, you will be personally liable for all damages and related legal fees as well as vehicle
            insurance claims and damages.</p>

          <p><strong>Renter Eligibility Continued Monitoring:</strong><br/>
            ExtraVagant may periodically monitor any renter&rsquo;s driving record and criminal history to ensure that
            such renter continues to qualify for membership under our Renter Eligibility Requirements. In addition,
            renter reviews can be triggered by a number of events. These may include, but are not limited to, the
            following:&nbsp;</p>

          <ul>
            <li>External notification by the State DMV (if supported by the driver license issuer state)</li>
            <li>External notification by any ExtraVagant user</li>
            <li>Internal notification by the ExtraVagant system functionality that we may establish and maintain from
              time to time and in our sole discretion
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>&nbsp;Vehicles registered in the state of New York are ineligible for listing on ExtraVagant. Furthermore,
            any rental which is collected or begins in the state of New York <a id="prohibiteduses"
                                                                                name="prohibiteduses"></a>(irrespective
            of the vehicle&rsquo;s state of registration) is also ineligible and excluded from ExtraVagant.</p>

          <h3><strong>ExtraVagant Prohibited Uses</strong></h3>

          <p>Only approved ExtraVagant drivers can book and drive a car while it is under a ExtraVagant reservation. To
            be an &ldquo;approved ExtraVagant driver&rdquo; means that the member has submitted his or her driver&#39;s
            license information, the driving history continues to meet our&nbsp;<a
              href="index.html#eligibilityrequirements" target="_blank">eligibility requirements</a>, and the member
            is still in good standing.</p>

          <p>The renter of a vehicle may allow any approved ExtraVagant driver to drive the car; all drivers shall be
            jointly and severally liable during the rental, but the renter shall remain primarily liable for the
            rental.</p>

          <p>Engaging in any Prohibited Uses with a ExtraVagant vehicle will be grounds for fees, suspension or
            cancellation of your membership. It will also lower the renter&#39;s liability coverage to state minimum
            limits or nullify coverage where allowable by applicable state law; if the owner has encouraged the
            engagement in a Prohibited Use, their coverage may be similarly reduced. Engaging in any Prohibited Uses
            may also eliminate any coverage for the renter for any claims related to physical damage.</p>

          <p><strong>Prohibited vehicle uses and activities include:</strong></p>

          <ul>
            <li>Permitting someone who is not an approved ExtraVagant driver to drive a ExtraVagant vehicle.</li>
            <li>Driving a manual transmission car without being expert in the use of clutches and manual
              transmissions. Note: If the drivetrain of a manual transmission car is damaged, the renter will be
              presumed to be at fault and will be held fully liable for repair of any damaged components of the car.
            </li>
            <li>Allowing the ExtraVagant vehicle to be pushed or towed by anyone other than an authorized law
              enforcement or a ExtraVagant approved service vehicle.
            </li>
            <li>Using a ExtraVagant vehicle
              <ul>
                <li>to tow or push anything</li>
                <li>other than on paved roads (whether &quot;off-roading&quot;, driving on unimproved roads or parking
                  areas, or otherwise)
                </li>
                <li>in any race, test or competition</li>
                <li>with the intention to cause damage, or with wanton, willful, or reckless disregard for safety</li>
                <li>to carry persons or property for hire, such as a taxi or parcel delivery service. You may,
                  however, use the car for business purposes, such as attending meetings and carrying associated
                  materials
                </li>
                <li>unless a reservation has been booked. Using ExtraVagant vehicles without reservations or outside
                  your reservation time constitutes unauthorized use
                </li>
                <li>during or due to use in the commission of a crime or any other illegal activity or purpose</li>
                <li>while the driver is under the influence of
                  <ul>
                    <li>alcohol above the legal limit or</li>
                    <li>any drug or medication under the effects of which the operation of a vehicle is prohibited or
                      not recommended
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>when it has been loaded beyond its rated capacity or with more passengers than the vehicle has
                  seat belts
                </li>
                <li>outside the continental United States or</li>
                <li>without a valid license, or if you do not meet our&nbsp;<a
                  href="index.html#eligibilityrequirements" target="_blank">eligibility requirements</a>. It is your
                  responsibility to inform us when your license is expired or suspended, or if you believe you may no
                  longer meet our Eligibility Requirements
                </li>
                <li>to transport any flammable, toxic, volatile, dangerous or illegal substances</li>
                <li>to transport a pet outside of a pet carrier that keeps all pet hair inside the carrier</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Making any alterations, additions or improvements to any vehicle.</li>
            <li>Smoking in the car.</li>
            <li><a id="wearandtear" name="wearandtear"></a>Fueling a ExtraVagant vehicle with an improper type of fuel.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3><strong>ExtraVagant Wear and Tear Policy</strong></h3>

          <p>Light &ldquo;wear and tear&rdquo; that is part of the normal operation of a classNameic and/or exotic vehicle
            is an inherent part of renting out a car; the owner is not &ldquo;protected&rdquo; against light wear and
            tear, nor is the renter &ldquo;responsible&rdquo; for wear and tear resulting from normal usage of the
            car. Wear and tear may include engine wear, brake and suspension wear, minor scuffing of the interior
            surfaces, as well as minor (less than 1 inch in length) nicks, scratches, abrasions or dents to the
            exterior (including wheels) normally associated with street parking, shopping cart bumps, and the
            like.</p>

          <p>However, renters are fully responsible for, and ExtraVagant does not provide any protection to renters for
            1) any damage related to &ldquo;misuse&rdquo; or&nbsp;<a href="index.html#prohibiteduses" target="_blank">Prohibited
              Uses</a> of the vehicle, 2) any damage to the interior of the car, or 3) any mechanical damage resulting
            from a renter&rsquo;s improper driving (e.g., clutch damage from rough driving, suspension damage from
            running over speed bumps at high speed or into curbs, continuing to drive with warning indicator lights
            illuminated, etc).</p>

          <h3><strong>Clutch Policies</strong></h3>

          <p>A vehicle listed on ExtraVagant with its original clutch must be less than 5 years old to be eligible for
            consideration of reimbursement for clutch repairs. If the car is more than 5 years old, it may still be
            considered eligible if the clutch has been replaced by a factory certified mechanic fewer than 5 years
            ago.</p>

          <p>If it has been determined that renter misuse is the cause of the clutch damage, and written certification
            of that determination by a certified mechanic has been submitted, the owner will be entitled to
            proportional reimbursement. This proportional reimbursement is calculated by reference to the otherwise
            expected remaining life of the clutch, based on the mileage at the end of the reservation.</p>

          <p>We strongly suggest each owner should check with renter as to clutch proficiency prior to providing the
            car to the renter. We also recommend a joint test drive of the vehicle as per our checkout process, as
            each vehicle&#39;s clutch will perform differently.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>None of the above affects the basic principle that a renter must be proficient in use of a clutch, or
            they may be held liable for costs associated with the resulting damage to an owner&rsquo;s car.</p>

          <h3><strong>Tickets and Moving Violations Policy:</strong></h3>

          <p>Should a renter get a ticket, the renter is responsible for paying any ticket/s received during the
            reservation as well as any parking ticket/s received 24 hours after the end of the rental. If you find a
            parking ticket on your car or one is mailed to you, please pay it, and send a copy to us at <a
              href="mailto:help@ExtraVagant.com">help@ExtraVagant.com</a>&nbsp; and we will reimburse you by adding the
            amount to your next owner payment. (Please note that ExtraVagant is not responsible for late fees added
            onto unpaid toll notices or parking tickets.) Please remember that for full reimbursement, we&#39;ll need
            to see the complete date and time of the violation, as well as a copy of the ticket.</p>

          <p>If the ticket is a moving violation, and particularly a photo-ticket where the driver is not identified,
            we will provide (upon request to <a href="mailto:help@ExtraVagant.com">help@ExtraVagant.com</a>) <a
              id="feespolicy" name="feespolicy"></a>documentation to you to support your contesting of the violation
            and/or transferring of the violation to the renter. Please note that procedures differ by
            jurisdiction.&nbsp;</p>

          <h3><strong>ExtraVagant Fees Policy</strong></h3>

          <p><strong>Service Fees</strong><br/>
            ExtraVagant charges service fees to the renter for each rental booked through ExtraVagant.com. The fees for
            each are listed below. Failure to charge any of the below fees or other indulgences shall not constitute a
            waiver of the right to exercise the same in the event another fee should become due at any other time.</p>

          <p><strong>Renter Service Fee</strong><br/>
            10% service fee will be charged to the vehicle renter for each rental booked.</p>

          <p><strong>Booking Fee: Individual Owners</strong><br/>
            ExtraVagant takes 35% of each reservation. This fee covers the cost of the insurance, towing, payment
            processing, listing and availability management, and support services provided by ExtraVagant to both the
            owner and renter during the rental period.</p>

          <p><strong>Administrative Fees</strong><br/>
            A fee of $25.00 will be charged for any administrative event such as neglecting to pay for a parking or
            speeding ticket during a rental period. The at-fault user incurs the charge.</p>

          <p><strong>Late Fees</strong><br/>
            Returning a car late can really inconvenience the car owner. There is a 15-minute grace period with each
            rental. If a Renter returns a car late, without notifying and communicating with the Owner or ExtraVagant,
            they will be charged the hourly rate of that vehicle along with a $50.00 late fee for each hour the
            vehicle is late, up to $500. ExtraVagant commission will be charged on both the late fee and the hourly
            rate. These charges will be added in addition to the agreed upon rental rate between the Owner and Renter.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Excess Mileage Fee</strong><br/>
            Renters will be charged for all excess mileage as designated per vehicle along with a $25.00
            Administrative Fee.</p>

          <p><strong>Gas Fee</strong><br/>
            If the car is returned with less than the amount of gas as at the start of the rental, the Renter will be
            charged $6.00 per gallon of missing gas along with a $25.00 Administrative Fee.</p>

          <p><strong>Citation &amp; Tolls Fee</strong><br/>
            In the event that a Renter fails to pay for a parking ticket, speeding ticket, toll, or other citation
            that occurs during or subsequent to a rental, a fee equal to the highest amount on the citation will be
            charged to the Renter along with a $25.00 Administrative Fee.</p>

          <p><strong>Cleaning Fee</strong><br/>
            We understand that cars get dirty out on the road. If the car is returned and is deemed to require
            additional cleaning due to smoke, pets, excessive trash, sand, neglect, etc., a cleaning fee of up to $350
            may be imposed along with a $25.00 Administrative Fee.</p>

          <p><a id="maintenancepolicy" name="maintenancepolicy"></a>*ExtraVagant reserves the right to charge an
            administrative or inconvenience fee, plus any costs incurred by ExtraVagant, for categories not explicitly
            noted above.</p>

          <h3><strong>ExtraVagant Maintenance Policy</strong></h3>

          <p><strong>Regularly Scheduled Maintenance: </strong>The Owner is responsible for obtaining regularly
            scheduled maintenance for the Car in accordance with all government and manufacturer recommendations
            (&#39;Maintenance&#39;). The Service may make certain assumptions about your Maintenance requirements
            based on information you provide about the Car. Upon request by ExtraVagant, the Owner is responsible for
            providing proof of Maintenance to ExtraVagant, in the form of acceptable documentation signed by the
            Car&#39;s mechanic, or if available, a proof of maintenance feature on the Service. Should the Owner fail
            to do this, ExtraVagant may suspend the Car from the Service until acceptable proof of Maintenance is
            received.</p>

          <p><strong>Operability: </strong>The Owner is responsible for maintaining the Car in a way that is safely
            operable by any Renter. The Owner may not place in the Car any modifications, devices, equipment or other
            items that may interfere with the safe operation of the vehicle.</p>

          <p><strong>Cleanliness:</strong> The Owner is responsible for making sure that the Car is clean at the start
            of each Rental period.</p>

          <p>Failure to maintain your car in sound mechanical condition will subject your car to removal from the
            marketplace. Furthermore, you are responsible for all costs flowing from the failure to properly maintain
            the car and up to a $250 Administrative Fee.</p>

          <p><strong>Safety Recall Terms</strong><br/>
            To ensure safety for our renters and to comply with regulations, ExtraVagant requires vehicle owners to
            confirm that any safety recalls have been resolved and that related repairs have been completed before
            listing their vehicle on ExtraVagant.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <p>If you receive notice of a safety recall at any point after listing your vehicle on ExtraVagant, you will
            need to make your vehicle unavailable until the recall repairs have been completed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <p>If your vehicle is in the possession of a renter when you receive a safety recall notice, you must notify
            ExtraVagant as soon as possible so that you can make the necessary repair.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Visit <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/recalls" target="_blank">the National Highway Traffic Safety
            Administration</a> site is an easy way to ensure your vehicle doesn&rsquo;t have any open recalls which
            have not been repaired prior <strong><a id="userpolicies" name="userpolicies"></a></strong>to listing your
            vehicle on ExtraVagant.</p>

          <h3><strong>ExtraVagant User Policies</strong></h3>

          <p>August 15, 2017</p>

          <p><strong>ExtraVagant Smoking Policy</strong><br/>
            Renters or their passengers are not permitted to smoke in any vehicle in the ExtraVagant marketplace. If
            the owner reports the smell of smoke within 24 hours after a reservation has ended, that renter will be
            assessed a cleaning fee of up to $350 along with a $25.00 Administrative Fee. The renter may also be
            subject to removal from the marketplace.</p>

          <p>If there is a smoke smell at the beginning of the reservation, please report it via e-mail to <a
            href="mailto:support@ExtraVagant.com">support@ExtraVagant.com</a> or via the checkout app at the very
            beginning of your reservation so that you are not held responsible for the violation. If the owner smokes
            in their car, it is their responsibility to include this information in the listing. If the owner fails to
            inform a renter that their vehicle smells of smoke prior to the beginning of the rental, the renter may be
            entitled to a full refund and the owner subject to a&nbsp;<a href="index.html#feespolicy"
                                                                         target="_blank">fee</a> or removal from the
            marketplace.</p>

          <p><strong>ExtraVagant Pet Policy</strong><br/>
            Pets are not allowed in cars without the owner&rsquo;s explicit consent. If an owner reports that a renter
            has transported a pet without their authorization, the renter will be subject to additional&nbsp;<a
              href="index.html#feespolicy" target="_blank">fees</a> and may also be subject to removal from the
            marketplace.</p>

          <p><strong>ExtraVagant Late Return Policy</strong><br/>
            Owners are counting on renters to return the car at the originally scheduled time; failure to do so can
            result in significant inconvenience for the owner. Please be considerate and return the car on time, and
            if there is any chance there will be a late return, contact the owner immediately to request an extension.
            If an extension cannot be booked (whether because the owner or car are unavailable, there are insufficient
            funds, or otherwise), the renter must return the car at the originally scheduled end time.</p>

          <p>To assess a late fee for the day, the owner should e-mail <a
            href="mailto:support@ExtraVagant.com">support@ExtraVagant.com</a> within 24 hours of the scheduled end of
            the reservation, identifying the renter&rsquo;s name and the time the vehicle was returned. If the renter
            disputes the timing, they should provide evidence indicating when the car was actually returned.</p>

          <p>Late fees charged to the renter are described in our&nbsp;<a href="index.html#feespolicy"
                                                                          target="_blank">Fees Policy</a>, and begin
            to accrue following the 15 minute grace period. They are billed in increments of an hour. <strong><a
              id="cancellation" name="cancellation"></a></strong>In the event of very substantial lateness, additional
            fees may be assessed.</p>

          <p><strong>ExtraVagant Cancellation Policy</strong><br/>
            Renters may cancel their trip through our site or mobile app, and the cancellation is effective
            immediately. Rentals may be cancelled with at least 48 hours notification at no charge. If a cancellation
            is made with less than 48 hours notification, the cancelling user will be charged the full fee of the
            Rental plus a $25 inconvenience fee. If an owner wishes to cancel a booked trip, they must notify the
            renter via on-site messaging at least 48 hours in advance, and contact us at <a
              href="mailto:support@ExtraVagant.com">support@ExtraVagant.com</a> to indicate their desire to do so.
            Renters are counting on owners to provide the car, so repeated cancellations will subject the owner to
            removal from the marketplace.</p>

          <p><strong>ExtraVagant Security Deposit Policy</strong><br/>
            We require a security deposit (minimum $250) before you may drive the car. If your payment card is a debit
            card, this amount will be deducted from your account; if it is a credit card, the amount will be
            pre-authorized. In each case, this will usually happen when you initially rent the car. However, if the
            trip is scheduled to start more than a week from the time you&rsquo;ve paid for the rental, the security
            deposit will be charged 7 days prior to the trip starting; if the security deposit fails, your trip will
            be automatically cancelled. This deposit will be reversed 72 hours after you return the car in the
            condition that you first rented it. Depending on your bank and the means of payment, it may take up to 7
            business days after we release the deposit for the funds to be available in your account. Credit cards
            will usually show a swifter return of the funds availability, as they will be a release of authorization.
          </p>

          <p><strong>ExtraVagant Gas Policy</strong><br/>
            Renters are responsible for replacing any gas used during the rental, using the appropriate fuel (i.e.,
            regular, premium, or diesel). If a car is returned with less gas than when it was picked up, in order to
            seek reimbursement, the owner should report the cost of replacing the shortage to the renter and <a
              href="mailto:support@ExtraVagant.com">support@ExtraVagant.com</a> within 72 hours, including a receipt,
            and the renter will be charged for the cost, plus an inconvenience fee. Photographs of the receipt and
            photographs of the fuel levels must be included and must have been taken within the first 24 hours of the
            end of the trip. We recommend that owners keep the tank full in order to make it easier for everyone to
            determine how much gas the renter should refill. Renters should keep gas receipts for at least 5 days in
            case there is any dispute by the owner.</p>
