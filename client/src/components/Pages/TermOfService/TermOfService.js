          <h3><strong>TERMS FOR RENTERS</strong></h3>

          <p>The following Sections apply if you rent a car using the Hagerty ExtraVagant marketplace:</p>

          <p><strong>Information provided to Hagerty ExtraVagant:</strong></p>

          <p>As part of establishing and maintaining your status as an authorized renter through the Hagerty
            ExtraVagant marketplace, you will need to provide certain information about yourself and your driving
            record. You understand and agree that you must meet the <a href="../policies.html#eligibilityrequirements"
                                                                       target="_blank">eligibility requirements</a> at
            all times that you use a car through the marketplace; if, after initial approval, you later fail to meet
            the eligibility requirements (e.g., you have a subsequent driving violation that would make you
            ineligible), you are required to inform us of the change in status, and refrain from renting or driving
            cars via Hagerty ExtraVagant. As stated above, you have authorized Hagerty ExtraVagant to obtain your
            driving record and other applicable reports at any time, to verify that you meet the eligibility
            requirements of the marketplace. You understand and agree that Hagerty ExtraVagant may periodically request
            additional verification of eligibility and proper verification of usage from you as a renter, and that if
            you fail to provide satisfactory evidence of your continued compliance with this Agreement, Hagerty
            ExtraVagant may terminate your membership immediately. Hagerty ExtraVagant may, subject to these Terms of
            Service and the <a href="../privacy-notice/index.html" target="_blank">Privacy Notice</a>, retain and
            continue to use for its own internal purposes any information previously provided by you. All your
            information will be held and treated in accordance with the <a href="../privacy-notice/index.html"
                                                                           target="_blank">Privacy Notice</a>. To
            note, any failure to disclose car-related violations, accidents or other material information is grounds
            for immediate rejection or termination of your membership, effective as of such failure.</p>

          <p><strong>Fees and Losses:</strong></p>

          <p>You are responsible for paying all fees when they come due in connection with your use of the marketplace
            and the Services. You authorize Hagerty ExtraVagant to charge any payment cards on file in your account for
            all amounts due, including but not limited to, security deposits, processing fees, usage fees,
            fines/penalties, deductibles, and damages, and you furthermore represent and warrant that you have the
            right to make this authorization. You will be responsible for payment of usage fees from the start of your
            rental period until the time you return the car. You will be responsible for all of the costs relating to
            any citations and fines (e.g. tolls, parking tickets, towing fines) incurred during the rental period (and
            after, if the car has not been parked in an authorized and legal parking space). Regarding damage, losses,
            or other liabilities, you acknowledge that any personal insurance you have available to you (e.g.,
            personal auto insurance, insurance from credit cards, etc.) will be the primary source of funds for your
            liabilities hereunder and the protection offered by Hagerty ExtraVagant will not be available to you until
            your personal insurance has been exhausted. Additionally, Hagerty ExtraVagant protection may not be
            available to you in the event you breach your obligations under this Agreement (e.g. if you drive a
            vehicle while under the influence of drugs or alcohol or otherwise violate any of the <a
              href="../policies.html#userpolicies" target="_blank">Hagerty ExtraVagant User Policies</a>). Subject to
            the coverage and protection available to you, you acknowledge that you are fully responsible for any
            damage, losses or other liabilities relating to your rental activities through the Hagerty ExtraVagant
            marketplace. You agree that in the event damage is reported, Hagerty ExtraVagant may immediately charge you
            up to the amount stipulated with the protection package that you selected when you booked the car. Nothing
            in this Agreement is intended to limit your responsibilities or Hagerty ExtraVagant&rsquo;s legal rights in
            connection with your use of the marketplace (or any vehicles rented through the marketplace) or any
            Services. You acknowledge that Hagerty ExtraVagant does require and hold a deposit as part of the
            reservation of a car.</p>

          <p><strong>Use of the Car:</strong></p>

          <p>When you rent a car through Hagerty ExtraVagant, you may use the car only for your personal use and not
            for any commercial purposes (e.g. running a taxi service). You must exercise reasonable care in your use
            of the car. In the event Hagerty ExtraVagant has any concern about your use of a vehicle, Hagerty
            ExtraVagant may terminate your reservation in its discretion at any time and require the return of the
            vehicle, including recovering the vehicle on behalf of the owner. You are required to wear seatbelts
            during the operation of the car and to require that all of your passengers wear seatbelts as well. You are
            also required to meet any laws or regulations concerning car seats and other protections for young
            passengers. The Hagerty ExtraVagant User Policies section provides a list of <a
              href="../policies.html#prohibiteduses" target="_blank">Prohibited Uses</a> of any car rented through the
            Hagerty ExtraVagant marketplace. The list isn&rsquo;t meant to be exhaustive. If you have any concerns
            about your planned use, please contact Hagerty ExtraVagant customer service at <a
              href="mailto:support@ExtraVagant.com">support@ExtraVagant.com</a>. You will be fully responsible for any
            claims, loss or damage related to your misuse of a car. Renters also acknowledge that using a vehicle in a
            prohibited manner may lower the renter&rsquo;s liability coverage to state minimum limits or nullify
            coverage, where allowed by applicable state law, and may furthermore nullify any comprehensive or
            collision protection.</p>

          <p><strong>Condition of the Car:</strong></p>

          <p>You understand that, unless otherwise specifically noted, the cars offered though the Hagerty ExtraVagant
            marketplace are owned by third parties and are not owned or maintained by Hagerty ExtraVagant. Each owner
            is responsible for maintaining and repairing the car(s) they offer through the marketplace in a roadworthy
            condition and is ultimately responsible for the condition of the car at the beginning of the rental
            period. Please complete a visual inspection of any rented car before you begin your use of the car. If you
            find damage in your initial inspection, you must notify Hagerty ExtraVagant immediately, to avoid any
            confusion about your role in the cause of the damage, or you may be held liable for any damage. As an
            alternative, you and the owner can jointly agree and document such agreement, with supporting photographs,
            of any pre-existing damage for which you as the renter should not be liable. If you find damage on your
            initial inspection and fail to report it, Hagerty ExtraVagant may assume that the damage occurred during
            your rental period. If, after your initial inspection, you believe that the car is not safe enough to
            drive, please do not use the car; in that event, please contact the Hagerty ExtraVagant team immediately
            at <a href="tel:1-877-922-1702">1-877-922-1702</a>.</p>

          <p><strong>Incident Reporting:</strong></p>

          <p>You must immediately report any damage to the car you are using to Hagerty ExtraVagant at <a
            href="mailto:support@ExtraVagant.com">support@ExtraVagant.com</a>, or <a
            href="tel:1-877-922-1702">1-877-922-1702</a>, and if there has been a collision, to the police as well.
            You will need to use all reasonable efforts to secure evidence from any available witnesses and to provide
            Hagerty ExtraVagant with a written description of the incident and any other information Hagerty ExtraVagant
            may request, including identity and insurance information of any parties involved in the incident. You are
            also required to cooperate in any loss investigation conducted by Hagerty ExtraVagant, our claims
            administrators, or insurers. After an incident, you may not continue to use the car unless you have the
            explicit permission of Hagerty ExtraVagant staff. Failure to timely report an incident may reduce or
            invalidate protection from Hagerty ExtraVagant.</p>

          <p><strong>Insurance:</strong></p>

          <p>In addition to the terms of the Protection section above, you understand and agree that Hagerty
            ExtraVagant will provide primary liability insurance for the owner and that renters will not look to an
            owner&rsquo;s policy for coverage in accordance with <a href="../policies.html#userpolicies"
                                                                    target="_blank">Hagerty ExtraVagant User
              Policies</a> and all available state car sharing statutes. Hagerty ExtraVagant will provide certain
            liability insurance and protection against physical damage losses as described in this Agreement and
            the <a href="../policies.html#userpolicies" target="_blank">Hagerty ExtraVagant User Policies</a>. You are
            fully responsible for paying any damages not covered by insurance, as well as insurance deductibles, fees,
            expenses, liens, and fines arising out of your use of a Hagerty ExtraVagant car. If Hagerty ExtraVagant
            advances any payment on your behalf, you will continue to be responsible for such amounts and will adhere
            to Hagerty ExtraVagant&rsquo;s schedule for re-payment of those amounts to Hagerty ExtraVagant.</p>

          <p><strong>Waiver:</strong></p>

          <p>Hagerty ExtraVagant provides a marketplace to allow car owners and renters to connect in an easy and
            efficient way. Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, Hagerty ExtraVagant and the applicable car
            owner do not intend to take liability with respect to your use of the Hagerty ExtraVagant marketplace, the
            Services, or the applicable car(s).</p>

          <p>AS SUCH, YOU WAIVE ANY AND ALL RIGHTS YOU HAVE TO SUE OR MAKE CLAIMS AGAINST HAGERTY ExtraVagant AND ITS
            RESPECTIVE DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, AGENTS, OR EMPLOYEES (THE &ldquo;HAGERTY ExtraVagant PARTIES&rdquo;) AND
            THE CAR OWNER FOR ANY DAMAGES OR LOSSES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF THIS MARKETPLACE
            OR ANY SERVICES INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, A CAR NOT BEING AVAILABLE WHEN IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE, ANY
            MALFUNCTION OF OR DEFICIENCY IN A CAR, ANY BREACH OF WARRANTY OR OTHER OBLIGATION BY ANY MANUFACTURER OR
            OTHER THIRD PARTY, ANY PERSONAL INJURY OR PROPERTY DAMAGE SUFFERED BY YOU OR ANY OF YOUR PASSENGERS AND,
            IN THE CASE OF THE HAGERTY ExtraVagant PARTIES, ANY ACTIONS OR INACTION OF THE CAR OWNER. YOUR WAIVER DOES
            NOT EXTEND TO ANY DAMAGES OR LOSSES RESULTING FROM ANY PARTY&rsquo;S GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL
            MISCONDUCT.</p>

          <p>IF YOU ARE A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT, YOU WAIVE CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE &sect;1542, WHICH STATES: &ldquo;A
            GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR
            HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH <strong><a id="owner" name="owner"></a></strong>IF
            KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.&rdquo;</p>

          <h3><strong>TERMS FOR OWNERS</strong></h3>

          <p>The following Sections apply if you rent out your car through the Hagerty ExtraVagant marketplace:</p>

          <p><strong>Information Given at Registration:</strong>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>When you sign up for Hagerty ExtraVagant, you will identify a particular passenger car(s) that you want to
            list for rent through the marketplace. Each car must meet the requirements provided by Hagerty ExtraVagant
            on the Hagerty ExtraVagant site from time to time. You may only use the marketplace in connection with cars
            that you own or otherwise have all the necessary rights and permissions to rent out.</p>

          <p><strong>Car Availability:&nbsp;</strong></p>

          <p>Once you accept a reservation and it is booked, you are required to make the car available as expected by
            the renter. You must also include the general location of the car on your profile page and ensure that the
            car is available at that location at the beginning of the rental period.</p>

          <p><strong>Rental Fees:</strong>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>You will have the ability to set and revise the vehicle&rsquo;s rental rates as you choose. Hagerty
            ExtraVagant will pay you the amount collected from those who rent your car, less the applicable fees
            payable to Hagerty ExtraVagant, as well as any taxes or similar charges that Hagerty ExtraVagant collects.
            You acknowledge that Hagerty ExtraVagant&rsquo;s fees may change from time to time. A current fee schedule
            can be found at <a href="../policies.html#feespolicy" target="_blank">Hagerty ExtraVagant Fees Policy</a>.
            The fees that apply to you will be the same as posted on the Hagerty ExtraVagant site at the time of the
            applicable rental. Please note that you are fully responsible for all taxes relating to or arising out of
            your activities under this Agreement. Hagerty ExtraVagant will need certain information from you to ensure
            we can report income paid to you as required by law. Hagerty ExtraVagant may withhold payments until we
            have received that information from you.</p>

          <p><strong>Maintenance:&nbsp;</strong></p>

          <p>You are required to regularly check your car for any defects in its operations or safety and have your
            car inspected as described in the <a href="../policies.html#maintenancepolicy" target="_blank">Maintenance
              Policy</a>. You promise that, always, your car will be in safe and roadworthy condition, in good
            mechanical condition, and in full compliance with all applicable state inspection and registration
            requirements. You agree to respond to any recall or similar safety notices and to complete any recommended
            action promptly. If Hagerty ExtraVagant believes that your car does not conform to reasonable standards,
            Hagerty ExtraVagant will notify you and reserves the right to refrain from listing your car on the
            marketplace until its concerns have been resolved.</p>

          <p><strong>Decals:&nbsp;</strong></p>

          <p>Hagerty ExtraVagant may, from time to time and at its expense, require that certain labels or other
            markings, be temporarily affixed to your car while you participate in the marketplace. Hagerty ExtraVagant
            will provide instructions for removal of those labels or decals in connection with any termination of your
            participation in the marketplace.</p>

          <p><strong>Event Reporting:</strong>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>If you believe that a renter has caused any damage to your car, you are required to report that damage as
            soon as you become aware of it (and in any event, no more than 24 hours after the reservation) and to
            provide reasonable cooperation in our investigation of the damage. In any event, with each break in rental
            activity you need to inspect your car and report any damage that you believe was caused by a renter. Based
            on its investigation, Hagerty ExtraVagant will reasonably determine whether the damage was caused during
            the renter&rsquo;s use of the car. If it was, Hagerty ExtraVagant will reimburse you for the loss as
            described below. If Hagerty ExtraVagant is not given prompt notice as described in this paragraph, or if
            you do not provide reasonable cooperation in our investigation, we may not be able to determine the cause.
            In that case, you agree that we may decline any financial responsibility for such damage.</p>

          <p><strong>Physical Damage:</strong></p>

          <p>Subject to all the terms of this Agreement, during each rental period, Hagerty ExtraVagant will bear the
            risk of theft, destruction, or damage with respect to your car. In the event of a loss that is covered by
            this Agreement, Hagerty ExtraVagant will either pay you the reasonable and actual expenses of repair of the
            car or, if that amount is greater than the agreed cash value of your car, pay you the agreed cash value.
            Note, if Hagerty ExtraVagant insurer chooses to pay you the agreed cash value for your car, you will be
            required to transfer title to the car to Hagerty ExtraVagant or its agent. The standard for the
            car&rsquo;s &ldquo;agreed cash value&rdquo; will be the amount agreed upon during the listing process and
            subsequent approved adjustments or other industry-accepted, comparable source as determined by Hagerty
            ExtraVagant or its third-party claims administrators in their discretion. There are some exceptions to
            Hagerty ExtraVagant obligations under this Section: Hagerty ExtraVagant is not responsible for any personal
            property that is taken from your car or damaged during a rental period. We recommend that you remove all
            personal property before making the car available for a reservation. In addition, you should expect
            normal <a href="../policies.html#wearandtear" target="_blank">wear and tear</a> on your car, including
            minor scrapes and dings, in connection with your participation in the marketplace. To the extent allowed
            by applicable law, Hagerty ExtraVagant will not reimburse you for normal wear and tear to your car.
            Furthermore, Hagerty ExtraVagant will only provide protection for &ldquo;comprehensive&rdquo; losses due to
            acts of nature (e.g., flood, earthquake, severe weather, etc.) that equal the corresponding comprehensive
            coverage you have in effect immediately prior to the reservation period, as evidenced by valid written
            documentation of your existing insurance.</p>

          <p><strong>Other Insurance and Legal Matters:</strong></p>

          <p>In addition to the terms provided above, You agree to comply with any and all applicable laws and
            regulations, including registration and minimum insurance requirements for your car. There is personal
            vehicle sharing legislation that may apply to you; for more information contact Hagerty ExtraVagant at
            support@ExtraVagant.com. With respect to any insurance policy procured by Hagerty ExtraVagant for your
            benefit, you hereby appoint Hagerty ExtraVagant as your attorney-in-fact solely for the purpose of filing
            claims, receiving payment and otherwise administering that policy. You also promise to maintain any proof
            of insurance in your car during every registration period, as requested by Hagerty ExtraVagant. Hagerty
            ExtraVagant may obtain insurance through a third-party provider or may choose to self-insure (meaning
            Hagerty ExtraVagant takes on part or all of the insurance obligations itself, subject to all applicable
            laws and regulations). As part of your participation in the marketplace, you must maintain your own
            insurance policy and meet any minimum insurance levels required by law. You agree to provide Hagerty
            ExtraVagant with information regarding your policy&rsquo;s coverage as may be requested from time to time.
            You must inform Hagerty ExtraVagant promptly in the event information previously provided changes. Except
            with respect to losses to be paid by Hagerty ExtraVagant as described above, you will be fully responsible
            for any losses or damages suffered by any party as the result of your activities under this Agreement.</p>

          <p><strong>Indemnification:</strong></p>

          <p>In the event of any claim for a loss or injury that occurs during the use of your car by a Hagerty
            ExtraVagant renter (or by Hagerty ExtraVagant itself), Hagerty ExtraVagant will defend and indemnify you
            against such claims as required by applicable law. In connection with any indemnified claim, you are
            required to: (a) give Hagerty ExtraVagant prompt written notice of the claim; (b) allow Hagerty ExtraVagant
            sole control over the defense of the claim; and (c) provide Hagerty ExtraVagant reasonable cooperation in
            its defense of the claim, at Hagerty ExtraVagant&rsquo;s expense.</p>

          <h3><strong>CONSENT TO DRIVER VERIFICATION</strong>&nbsp;</h3>

          <p>Hagerty ExtraVagant LLC (the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) has engaged Checkr, Inc. to obtain a consumer report
            and/or investigative consumer report for driver verification purposes. Checkr Inc. will provide a
            background investigation as a pre-condition of your engagement with the Company and in compliance with
            federal and state employment laws.&nbsp;</p>

          <p><strong>Rights under the FCRA:</strong></p>

          <p>The federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (&ldquo;FCRA&rdquo;) promotes the accuracy, fairness, and privacy
            of information in the files of consumer reporting agencies. There are many types of consumer reporting
            agencies, including credit bureaus and specialty agencies (such as agencies that sell information about
            check writing histories, medical records, and rental history records). Here is a summary of your major
            rights under the FCRA. For more information, including information about additional rights, go to <a
              href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore" target="_blank">www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore</a> or
            write to: Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 1700 G Street N.W., Washington, DC 20552.</p>

          <p>You must be told if information in your file has been used against you. Anyone who uses a credit report
            or another type of consumer report to deny your application for credit, insurance, or
            employment &ndash; or to take another adverse action against you &ndash; must tell you, and must give you
            the name, address, and phone number of the agency that provided the information.</p>

          <p>You have the right to know what is in your file. You may request and obtain all the information about you
            in the files of a consumer reporting agency (your &ldquo;file disclosure&rdquo;). You will be required to
            provide proper identification, which may include your Social Security number. In many cases, the
            disclosure will be free. You are entitled to a free file disclosure if:</p>

          <p>a person has taken adverse action against you because of information in your credit report;</p>

          <p>you are the victim of identity theft and place a fraud alert in your file; o your file contains
            inaccurate information as a result of fraud; you are on public assistance;</p>

          <p>you are unemployed but expect to apply for employment within 60 days.</p>

          <p>In addition, all consumers are entitled to one free disclosure every 12 months upon request from each
            nationwide credit bureau and from nationwide specialty consumer reporting agencies. See <a
              href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore"
              target="_blank">www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore</a> for additional information.</p>

          <p>You have the right to ask for a credit score. Credit scores are numerical summaries of your
            creditworthiness based on information from credit bureaus. You may request a credit score from consumer
            reporting agencies that create scores or distribute scores used in residential real property loans, but
            you will have to pay for it. In some mortgage transactions, you will receive credit score information for
            free from the mortgage lender.</p>

          <p>You have the right to dispute incomplete or inaccurate information. If you identify information in your
            file that is incomplete or inaccurate, and report it to the consumer reporting agency, the agency must
            investigate unless your dispute is frivolous. See <a href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore"
                                                                 target="_blank">www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore</a> for
            an explanation of dispute procedures.</p>

          <p>Consumer reporting agencies must correct or delete inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable information.
            Inaccurate, incomplete or unverifiable information must be removed or corrected, usually within 30 days.
            However, a consumer reporting agency may continue to report information it has verified as accurate.</p>

          <p>Consumer reporting agencies may not report outdated negative information. In most cases, a consumer
            reporting agency may not report negative information that is more than seven years old, or bankruptcies
            that are more than 10 years old.</p>

          <p>Access to your file is limited. A consumer reporting agency may provide information about you only to
            people with a valid need -&nbsp;usually to consider an application with a creditor, insurer, employer,
            landlord, or other business. The FCRA specifies those with a valid need for access.</p>

          <p>You must give your consent for reports to be provided to employers. A consumer reporting agency may not
            give out information about you to your employer, or a potential employer, without your written consent
            given to the employer. Written consent generally is not required in the trucking industry. For more
            information, go to <a href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore"
                                  target="_blank">www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore</a>.</p>

          <p>You may limit &ldquo;prescreened&rdquo; offers of credit and insurance you get based on information in
            your credit report. Unsolicited &ldquo;prescreened&rdquo; offers for credit and insurance must include a
            toll-free phone number you can call if you choose to remove your name and address from the lists these
            offers are based on. You may opt out with the nationwide credit bureaus at <a
              href="tel:1-888-5-OPTOUT">1-888-5-OPTOUT</a> (<a href="news://tel:1-888-567-8688">1-888-567-8688</a>).
          </p>

          <p>You may seek damages from violators. If a consumer reporting agency, or, in some cases, a user of
            consumer reports or a furnisher of information to a consumer reporting agency violates the FCRA, you may
            be able to sue in state or federal court.</p>

          <p>Identity theft victims and active-duty military personnel have additional rights. For more information,
            visit <a href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore"
                     target="_blank">www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore</a>.</p>

          <p>States may enforce the FCRA, and many states have their own consumer reporting laws. In some cases, you
            may have more rights under state law. For more information, contact your state or local consumer
            protection agency or your state Attorney General. For information about your federal rights,
            contact:&nbsp;</p>
